Data Science projects
Introduction
Task 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
- In the first task, I explored the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. 
- Leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, I aimed to uncover patterns and factors influencing survival rates. 

Task 2: MOVIE RATING PREDICTION
- Task 2 involved predicting movie ratings, a fascinating challenge that allowed me to dive into recommendation systems. 
- Through data preprocessing and model building, I aimed to create a predictive model for movie ratings.

Task 3: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
- I explore the sale of tv, radio and newspaper, This project focuses on predicting sales for a business.
- It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model to forecast future sales.
